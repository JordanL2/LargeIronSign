## How to Use

To make signs, use an iron block in a stonecutter. This will produce 16 signs.

Place the sign, then right-click it and select the character it should display. You can also enable/disable the trim here.

To change the text colour, hold a dye in your main hand and right-click the sign.

To change the background colour, hold a dye in your off hand and right-click the sign.

If you have a dye in both hands, you can set both the text and background colour at the same time.
